Project:        Assignment 1
Description:    Program to read a CSV file with movie data and process data into structs 
                for each movie. The structs are then used to create linked lists. The user 
                can then choose from 4 options to view movies. The program then prints out
                the data about the movies based on the user's choice.

README TEXT FILE: 



The zip folder named "montanek_program1.zip" provided will have 4 files including: 

1. main.c
2. movies (executable file)
3. README.txt (this file)
4. movies_sample_1.CSV

Upon zip extraction, the files will be available in the 
montanek/CS344/vsprojects/Assignment\1/ directory.
Directions for compiling main.c are as follows: 

1. gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies main.c
2. ./movies movies_sample_1.csv



The following execution uses the GNU99 compiler, and contains the
"#define _GNU_SOURCE" for ease of use if
the above command line for gnu99 is not used.
